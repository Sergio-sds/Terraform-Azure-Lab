# Terraform Labs

Hands-on Terraform practice covering variables, outputs, validation, state management, and Azure resource deployment.  
The goal is to build strong **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** foundations while progressively learning how to provision resources in Azure.

### Lab2 — Azure Basics
- First connection to Azure provider.
- Deployed basic resources to understand authentication and setup.

### Lab3 — Azure Resources
- Expanded Azure deployments with more services.
- Reinforced modular code and reusable blocks.

### Lab4 — Azure Key Vault + Logs
- Created and managed secrets in Azure Key Vault.
- Implemented logging and diagnostics.

### Lab5 — Networking
- Configured network settings.
- Practiced security groups and connectivity.

### Lab6 — Azure VM
- Deep dive into VM lifecycle.
